This is my envisioning of the Bro app from Season 2 of Silicon Valley. There's already an app built to capitalize on the free publicity given by the show, but it's structured so that you can only send "bros" to other users of the app, and you need to know their usernames in order to do so. I didn't really like that, so the main goal here is to transform the app to text the word bro instead of making it purely user-to-user. This makes the app capable of doing something if you don't know any friend who uses it and makes my job a lot easier since there's no back-end required for this whatsoever.
